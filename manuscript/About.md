# Secrets of PowerShell Remoting
Principal author: Don Jones
Contributing author: Dr. Tobias Weltner
With contributions by Dave Wyatt and Aleksandar Nikolik

---

Introduced in Windows PowerShell 2.0, Remoting is one of PowerShell's most useful, and most important, core technologies. It enables you to run almost any command that exists on a remote computer, opening up a universe of possibilities for bulk and remote administration. Remoting underpins other technologies, including Workflow, Desired State Configuration, certain types of background jobs, and much more. This guide isn't intended to be a complete document of what Remoting is and does, although it does provide a good introduction. Instead, this guide is designed to document all the little configuration details that don't appear to be documented elsewhere.
